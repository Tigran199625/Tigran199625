### I'm a beginner Unity Developer. 

I love games, but I started to love creating them more.
At the moment I'm studying the Unity engine and the C# language.

I study on my own. I create games based on the knowledge gained for more practice.

Here is the list to the games made by me:

>  [The Adventures of Redy](https://github.com/Tigran199625/The_Adventures_of_Redy)
>  
>  [To The Top](https://tigran-avagyan.itch.io/to-the-top)
